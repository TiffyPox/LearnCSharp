Today is day sixty two of one hundred days of code. 
I have created another Extension Method that counts the number of sentences and paragraphs in a string. For bonus points, I was given the task of creating a program that reads a file and uses the Extension Method to count how many words, sentences and paragraphs are in that file.
The file my program is going to use is... this one. Unless my program proves otherwise, I have counted 89 words, 5 sentences and 3 paragraphs in this file.
